## Skin-Cure
Skin-Cure is an innovative mobile application that is changing the way people approach skincare. Skin-Cure is designed to cater to individuals looking for skincare solutions. It provides a comprehensive platform where users can discover and select products that are tailored to their specific skin needs.

The quiz addresses a variety of topics, including skin conditions (such as feeling congested, dehydrated, hormonal, irritated, super dry, stressed and tired, or really great), concerns (such as acne, aging, hyperpigmentation, or dehydration), lifestyle habits, and product preferences. Through a series of targeted questions, Skin-Cure learns about each user's unique skincare profile, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to their specific needs.
